## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

data2022<-read.csv("open_data_portal_2022.csv")
data2023<-read.csv("vornamen-muenchen-2023.csv")
data2022$Anzahl <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", data2022$Anzahl))
data2023$Anzahl <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", data2023$Anzahl))

#3c)
total_2022<-sum(data2022$Anzahl,na.rm = TRUE)
total_2023<-sum(data2023$Anzahl,na.rm = TRUE)
##so from the SUM result I can tell that the 2022 has bigger Babyboom

#3d)
data2022$year <- 2022
data2023$year <- 2023
